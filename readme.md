### Features

- **Voice Command Controls**:  
  Control the snake using voice commands such as "Up", "Down", "Left", and "Right". No need for a keyboardâ€”just speak and play!

- **Scoring System**:  
  Earn points by collecting randomly appearing foods on the game canvas. Your score increases as you consume more food.

- **Game Over Screen**:  
  When the snake collides with itself, a "Game Over" screen displays your final score, with an option to restart the game.

- **Randomized Colors**:  
  The snake and apples have randomly assigned colors each time you play, making the game visually dynamic and more engaging.
